# SwingingStrikeByCount

Created this to get the swinging strike rate of hitters by count in 2019. The data will be used as a part of a bigger project where I analyze player performance in different counts and who may be under/over performing. 

The data visualization I created using this data is here: https://datastudio.google.com/open/1I11Ub3NmUHq_9Tr8fcmAtNlFbk56uL1q
